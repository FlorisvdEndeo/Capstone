Meeting Joris 8 May agenda:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Practical details: proposal of Draft deadline (16 May), reader (Christian Majenz), presentation details, Timeline (extension from AUC) -> discuss at the end of Meeting
  \item I now see my interpretation of the aim of this algorithm was wrong. I'd like to walk you through how I see it now.
  Specific questions on about it:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Second quantized Hamiltonian, okay we simplify that. For physical implementation, Jordan Wigner or not?
  \item How does this work with $ \tilde{H} = H_0 + gV$
  \item Hodge Star? Confused about formula.
\end{itemize}
  \item Mathematics: We established that the calculation for $SV$ was nonsense, but I don't see how we can find the values without it
  \item So now scope Capstone: I'll go more in detail of how Zeno effect is manipulated to avoid the need for explicit approximation of time operator.
\end{itemize}
